This is the bot I'm running atm to do some arbs through liquidations and redemptions, and to update the price data of the STAB protocol.

It is completely undocumented, and I don't plan on cleaning it up. It was written super quickly and it works. It's just not important that it looks nice or people understand it. Hit me up if you have a question, I'd be glad to answer.

I run this script every 10 minutes.
